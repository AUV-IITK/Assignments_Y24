#Computer Vision

Executed Canny Edge Detection using RawCV

This included:
- Converting image to grayscale
- Using Gaussian Blur to reduce noise
- Calculating Gradient Magnitudes and Directions using Sobel Kernel
- Running Non Max suppression to thin out edges
- Applying Double thresholding to only keep necessary edges and remove unwanted edges detected
- Edge Tracking by Hysteresis
